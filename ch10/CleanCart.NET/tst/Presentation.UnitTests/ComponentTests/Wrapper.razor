@inherits ComponentBase

@* 
    This wrapper component exists solely for Blazor unit tests.

    Many MudBlazor components (such as tooltips, popovers, dialogs, and snackbars)
    rely on provider components like <MudPopoverProvider>, <MudDialogProvider>,
    and <MudSnackbarProvider>. In a real Blazor app, these providers normally live
    in MainLayout or App.razor, so every page automatically has them available.

    bUnit, however, renders components in isolation and does NOT load your layout.
    That means any component that expects MudBlazor providers will throw runtime
    errors during testing unless we supply those providers ourselves.

    This test-only wrapper recreates the minimal environment MudBlazor needs to
    function, and then exposes a @ChildContent slot where the component under test
    is rendered. This keeps the test environment lightweight while accurately
    reflecting the UI infrastructure the component depends on.
